This directory contains tooling to check the validity of the SAT solver. The
scripts require picosat to be present. These scripts can be combined with the
cnfuzz tools by Biere et.al.

To check whether the solver works correctly on a given CNF, use:

./toolCheck.sh ./pcasso.sh <input.cnf>

As the solver is a parallel solver, reproducing bugs is difficult. The following
command re-runs a call, until an expected buggy unsatisfiable result is showing
up:

./reproduce-error.sh <input.cnf>
